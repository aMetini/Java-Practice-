1.  Explain with your words what is Polymorphism. 
Polymorphism refers to the ability for a variable, function or class object to take on multiple forms.
2.  Explain with your words what is an Abstract class. 
Abstract classes are typically super classes that allow for polymorphism. It is restricted and cannot be used to create new class objects. Instead, a class must inherit the abstract class in order to access the classes abstract methods or constructors.
3.  Why we cannot instantiate an abstract class in java? 
You cannot instantiate an abstract class because it is incomplete (i.e. abstract), which will prevent the compiler to compile the code.
4.  Explain with your words what is a concrete class. 
A concrete class is a complete whose methods are all implemented.
